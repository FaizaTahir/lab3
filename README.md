These applications shall have both a server part and a client part. File transfer will use Server-Client architecture to move file contents from one application to the other.
The Client starts by checking the server status on a particular port. If the server is up, the client and server will form a logical connection which shall be used to transfer the file contents. 
The Java server will bind to port 55555, while C++ server will bind to 55556.
The applications must handle all common exceptions and errors and should be well documented.
